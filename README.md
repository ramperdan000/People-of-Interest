### Ada Lovelace
Born in 1815, Ada Lovelace was the child of famous English poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabelle Milbanke. Her mother, wanting to turn her away from poetry had her tutored in math and music. Her father also encouraged her to pursue a career in scince, setting Ada up to become a very gifted mathematician.
In 1833, Ada met Cambridge University professor Charles Babbage, who soon became her colleague. Soon after Ada met and married William King, who became the Count of Lovelace, making Ada the countess, or, for short, Ada Lovelace.
Despite her new life, she still continued to communicate with Babbage, who had built an analytical engine, a metal steam powered machine capable of performing different mathematical operations. In 1843, Babbage asked Lovelace to translate a description of his engine written by an Italian mathematician. Ada not only did this but alsoadded her own set of notes to the description.
Her notes included some of Babbages own calculations, some of which she corrected and talked about the achines applications, specifically how it could be used to calculate Bernoulli numbers. In essence, she had written a computer algorithm. This earned her the title as the Author of the First Computer Program.
She also said the device could be used to manipulate any type of algorithm, regardless of whether or not it had numbers, as long as it had a fixed set of rules. Basically, that it might be able to do what our modern computers do now. Though the Analytical Engine was never built, Ada's work was published in Britain, earning her praise.
